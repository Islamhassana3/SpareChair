# ChairShare

ChairShare is an Airbnb-style platform for service-based businesses with unused space. Salon owners, therapists, or studios can list spare chairs or rooms, set availability and pricing, and earn from underused capacity. Freelancers book spaces flexibly by the hour or day, with secure payments, ID verification, and reviews.

git clone https://github.com/Islamhassana3/SpareChair.git
cd SpareChair
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm run install-deps
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/chairshare"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key-here"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key"
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Set up the database**

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. **Verify your setup (optional but recommended)**

```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```

This script checks if all prerequisites are installed and properly configured.

6. **Start the development servers**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Backend server on http://localhost:5000
- React frontend on http://localhost:3000

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

If you encounter problems during setup, check these common issues:

**"Login failed" or cannot connect to backend:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Run `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health` to verify
- Check that `.env` file exists and has correct values

**Prisma errors:**
- Run `npx prisma generate` if you see "@prisma/client did not initialize"
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env` is correct

**Port already in use:**
- Kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9` (backend) or `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` (frontend)
